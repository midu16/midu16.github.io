For more information on the example of the OCP IPI reference architecture you can find at [Openshift 4 documentation][openshift-doc]

We are going to build the future posts on different topics over this example so by the end of the series of the posts you will achieve to have the Openshift 4.X installed on your baremetal hosts.
